<li>
DNA is the acronym for deoxyribonucleic acid.
</li> 
</br>
<li>
Your DNA can stretch from Earth to the Sun and back roughly 600 times. 
</li>
</br>
--> the strands of DNA in each of your cells would be 6 feet long if unwound and linked together. there are 100 trillion cells in your body, meaning that all your dna would stretch over 110 billion miles. 
</br>
<li>
Everyone is 99 percent alike
</li>
</br>
--> only 1%of the three billion base pairs in the human genome are unique to that person, meaning that every human being shares 99% of their DNA with every other human. 
</br>
<li>
A parent and child share 99.5% of the same DNA
</li>
</br>
<li>
You have 98% of your DNA in common with a chimpanzee
</li>
</br>
<li>
Assuming you can type 60 words per minute, eight hours a day, it would take you approximately 50 years to type the human genome.
</li>
</br>
<li>
Humans and cabbage share about 40-50% common DNA
</li>
</br>
<li>
DNA was discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1896, although until 1943, it was widely believed that proteins stored genetic information.
