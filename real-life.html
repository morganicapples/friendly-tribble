<p>The relationship and similarities between chimps and humans can be seen within the DNA structure of the two species. This diagram displays the similarity between x chromosomes evidence suggests that both chimps and humans share a common ancestor from about six to seven million years ago, and share about 98.8% of the same genes.

<p>
This diagram shows the genetic similarity between the two species.
The fact that all organisms have DNA in the first place, as well as the same bases to code for different proteins suggests that all life on earth has a single common ancestor which, over millions of years, evolved into dof species that populate the planet today.
Any interesting facts or controversies about this type of evidence.
