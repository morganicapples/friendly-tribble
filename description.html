<p>Scientists compare DNA sequences of genes from one organism to another to investigate their relationships.

</br>
</br>

All living organisms share:
<li>
The same genetic material (DNA)
</li>
<li>
The same, or highly similar, genetic codes
</li>
<li>
The same basic process of gene expression (transcription and translation)
</li>
<li>
The same molecular building blocks, such as amino acids/proteins
</li>
</br>

These common features mean that organisms have large sections of identical DNA, suggesting that all living things descended from a common ancestor. For instance, humans, cows, chickens, and chimpanzees all have a gene that codes for insulin, because this gene was already present in their last common ancestor.

</br>
</br>

DNA has four nitrogenous bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. These bases line up in a specific order and a group of three. They code for one of 20 amino acids. The order of those amino acids determines what protein is made. Comparing how many of the amino acids are in the same positions on the protein chain can explain how closely related two species are. For example, humans and chimpanzees only have one position where they are different on the amino chain, while humans and moths have 31 different positions. The percentage of differences in the DNA between two species, can indicate how long ago the species diverged through speciation. The greater the amount of differences, the greater the amount of time the two species have been separate.

</br>
</br>

Any changes in the DNA sequence can result in changed proteins, and hence changes in the traits those proteins control. When mistakes in the DNA replication process occur, mutations are formed. If these mutations occur in gametes/sex cells, the changes are passed down to the next generation and may affect the function of the offspring. These molecular changes can lead to microevolution of species.
