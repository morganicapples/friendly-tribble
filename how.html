Scientists can use DNA and protein structure to support the theory of evolution in multiple ways. Firstly, by comparing DNA and protein structures scientists can see that all animals share an evolutionary ancestor and all living organisms share: the same genetic material, similar genetic code, basic gene expressions and molecular building blocks. These similar DNA and protein structure features are the same in all living things. This is evidence for the theory of evolution as it supports the claim that all living things share a common ancestor.

Scientists can also compare homologous genes to support the theory of evolution. By comparing sequences of genes scientists can see how closely related different species are. An example of this is humans, chimpanzees and chickens. Humans and chickens share 64% identical insulin proteins while humans and chimpanzees share a 98% identical insulin protein. This shows that humans and chimpanzees and closely related while chickens and humans are not closely related. This supports the theory of evolution as it shows how two species of animals that are similar in physical and cognitive features are closely related through DNA compared to animals that do not share many physical and cognitive features who are not closely related through DNA. This supports the theory of evolution as it shows how the common ancestor evolved in different branches. ("Evidence for evolution", n.d.)
